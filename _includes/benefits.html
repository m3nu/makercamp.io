                    <br/><br/>Our mission is to increase the rate of success for crowdfunding projects by bringing a group of motivated people together at the same time right in the heart of where new things get made.

                    <br/><br/>We believe having 20 projects and a clear schedule will let us learn together, solve roadbloacks, negotiate better pricing, and reduce the risk.

                    <br/><br/>More than that, having a smart group of people give you feedback on your videos, your photos, your text can really help you polish your marketing.

                    <br/><br/>Before I go further, we should clarify that 87% of successful crowdfunding campaigns were done by first timers who had never done a campaign before.

                    <br/><br/>Crowdfunding is not only for stand alone products. We think it's a great way to bring products to market that could sell in retail or online stores such as Amazon.

                    <br/><br/>When you have a successful crowdfunding story, imagine how that could ignite your online store sales or get you in the door with a major retailer.

                    <br/><br/>Example: "This product raised over $x,000 dollars in 30 days and was successfully..."

                    <br/><br/>Our program is compressed into just four weeks right in the heart of the manufacturing zone of China. We have people who are fluent in Chinese to help, and we have organized the schedule so that we have time to work on the marketing copy, the product photos, the videos and meet manufacturers.

                    <br/><br/>We are also going to be kicking off the program about 6 weeks ahead of  when we meet in Hong Kong. This means we are going to hit the road running.

                    <br/><br/>Lastly, we want this to be fun. We have organized some trips to spas, some great restaurants and some other fun activities.

                    <br/><br/>Oh. We are not planning to make money on this because the organizers are also going to be part of the group and crowdfunding our own products.

                    <br/><br/>In fact, we are going to pass along group discounts to you and charge just enough to cover some transportation, and the translators who are going to be invovled.

                    <br/><br/>There are only 20 spots and we want to select people who are really motivated to make their product a reality.
