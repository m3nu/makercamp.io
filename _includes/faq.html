                        <h4>What kinds of products can I make</h4>

                            You are free to work on any product that you want. We will be visiting the Hong Kong Electronics fair for the first few days, so you would probably gain more if you have a product which aligns with this.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                            Our reason for focusing on electronics based products is the movement towards connected appliances, as well as the opportunity to tie your product to a mobile app or an online service. We belive these types of products provide real value for the customer and give an advantage in the long run.

                        <h4>What do I need to apply?</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                            You should already have a product idea and a problem you are looking to solve with it. Maybe even a target market and rough marketing strategy. Since we will visit the Hong Kong Electronics fair at the beginning of the program, you can also get inspirations from there and adapt something exisiting to your market.

                        <h4>Do I need to use Kickstarter or other Crowdfunding platforms to join?</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                            Crowdfunding is a great way to test demand for your product and reduce your risk by pre-selling a part of your first production run. If you already know your market, you can use other means of marketing as well.

                            The first part of the program is structured around attending the Electronics fair and a selection of factories together. In the second part we will have a location to work on our projects, while iterating with manufacturers.

                            There will be daily check-ins, breakfasts and dinners to discuss current progress and common problems. This will keep everyone motivated and accountable to their own goals.

                            During the first week we wil go to the trade fair, you can quickly meet representatives from many companies and get a sense for their ability to make products similar to the one you have in mind.

                        <p class="text-muted">
                            During weeks 2-4 we will be in Shenzhen, where many factories are located. You can visit the factories that you contacted during the trade fair. It is important to see their faccillities first hand.
